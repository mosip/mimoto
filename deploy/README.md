# Install Onboarder

* During the execution of the `install.sh` script, a prompt appears requesting information for the S3 bucket, including its name and URL.
* Once the job is completed, log in to S3 / NFS and check the reports. There should not be any failures.
* Note: If you are running the Onboarder in a separate INJI cluster, update the extraEnvVars section accordingly in [values.yaml](../partner-onboarder/values.yaml).

# Install mimoto
* Execute mimoto install script

  ```
  cd ../mimoto
  ./install.sh
  ```
* During the execution of the `install.sh` script, a prompt appears requesting information regarding the presence of a public domain and a valid SSL certificate on the server.
* If the server lacks a public domain and a valid SSL certificate, it is advisable to select the `n` option. Opting it will enable the `init-container` with an `emptyDir` volume and include it in the deployment process.
* The init-container will proceed to download the server's self-signed SSL certificate and mount it to the specified location within the container's Java keystore (i.e., `cacerts`) file.
* This particular functionality caters to scenarios where the script needs to be employed on a server utilizing self-signed SSL certificates.

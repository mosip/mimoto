# mimoto

## Overview
This repository contains source code for backend service of Inji Mobile and Inji Web. The modules exposes API endpoints.


## Build & run (for developers)
The project requires JDK 21, postgres and google client credentials
### without docker-compose Build & install
1. Install pgadmin and update application-default.properties file with values
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=
   spring.datasource.password=
   ```

2. **Configuring Cache Providers:**

   By default, **Mimoto** uses the **Caffeine** cache provider when running through Docker with the provided [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) or when running through the IDE.  
   You only need to install and configure **Redis** (or any other cache provider) if you want to store **application data** or **HTTP sessions** outside of Caffeine.  
   For detailed setup instructions (including running Redis with Docker CLI and updating configuration), see the [Cache Providers Setup Guide](#cache-providers-setup-guide) section.
      
3. Refer to the [How to create Google Client Credentials](docker-compose/README.md#how-to-create-google-client-credentials) section to create
   Google client credentials and update below properties in `application-local.properties`.
    ``` 
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=
    ```
4. Add identity providers as issuers in the `mimoto-issuers-config.json` file of [resources folder](src/main/resources/mimoto-issuers-config.json). For each provider, create a corresponding object with its issuer-specific configuration. Refer to the [Issuers Configuration](docker-compose/README.md#mimoto-issuers-configuration) section for details on how to structure this file and understand each field's purpose and what values need to be updated.

5. Add or update the verifiers clientId, redirect and response Uris in `mimoto-trusted-verifiers.json` file of [resources folder](src/main/resources/mimoto-trusted-verifiers.json) for Verifiable credential Online Sharing.

6. Keystore(oidckeystore.p12) Configuration:
   In the root directory, create a certs folder and generate an OIDC client. Add the onboard clientâ€™s key to the oidckeystore.p12 file and place this file inside the certs folder.
   Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.inji.io/inji-wallet/inji-mobile/technical-overview/customization-overview/credential_providers) for guidance on how to create the **oidckeystore.p12** file and add the OIDC client key to it.
   * The **oidckeystore.p12** file stores keys and certificates, each identified by an alias (e.g., mpartner-default-mimoto-insurance-oidc). Mimoto uses this alias to find the correct entry and access the corresponding private key during the authentication flow.
   * Update the **client_alias** field in the [mimoto-issuers-config.json](src/main/resources/mimoto-issuers-config.json) file with this alias so that Mimoto can load the correct key from the keystore.
   * Also, update the **client_id** field in the [same file](src/main/resources//mimoto-issuers-config.json) with the client_id used during the onboarding process.
   * Set the `oidc_p12_password` environment variable in the Mimoto service configuration inside docker-compose.yml to match the password used for the **oidckeystore.p12** file.
   * Update the following properties in applicatio-local.properties file
   ```properties
   mosip.oidc.p12.password=<your-keystore-password>
   mosip.kernel.keymanager.hsm.config-path=<path to the keystore file>
   mosip.kernel.keymanager.hsm.keystore-pass=<your-keystore-password>
    ```
   * Mimoto also uses this same keystore file (oidckeystore.p12) to store keys generated at service startup, which are essential for performing encryption and decryption operations through the KeyManager service.

7. To configure any Mobile Wallet specific configurations refer to the [Inji Mobile Wallet Configuration](docker-compose/README.md#inji-mobile-wallet-configuration) section.

8. Run the SQLs using <db name>/deploy.sh script. from [db_scripts folder](db_scripts/inji_mimoto)
   ```
   ./deploy.sh deploy.properties
   ```

9. Build the jar
    ```
    mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests=true
    ```

10. Run following command
    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local
    ```
### Cache Providers Setup Guide

To use Redis (or any other cache provider), the service must be **running** and **accessible to Mimoto**. Both services (cache provider and Mimoto) must be on the same Docker network.  
This can be done by adding them to a shared network in your `docker-compose.yml` file, or by using the following commands if they are running separately.

**Example: Using Redis as Cache Provider**

1. **Ensure Redis Service is Available and Connected:**

   - **Using Docker Compose:** Include the Redis service directly in your docker-compose.yml. Docker Compose will automatically place both services on a shared network.

   - **Using Docker CLI:** If you are running the services(Redis and Mimoto) separately using docker, use the following commands to create and connect them to a shared network.
     ```bash   
      docker pull redis:alpine # Pull the Redis image if not already available
      docker network create redis-net # Create a new network for the service and replace redis-net with your preferred network name
      docker run -d --network redis-net --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine # Run Redis on this new network, assigning it the hostname 'redis'
      docker network connect redis-net mimoto-service # Ensure Mimoto service is running and connect it to the same network as redis by running this commands. Replace the mimoto-service with actual name of Mimoto service
      docker restart mimoto-service
      ```

   - **Running Redis with Docker and starting Mimoto through the IDE:**
      - Use the following Docker command to start the Redis service and expose it on the default port 6379. Make sure this port is accessible from your local machine.
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name redis-server -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
     ```
      - Start Mimoto normally, following the instructions in steps 9 and 10.

2. **Update the following properties** in
   - [application-local.properties](src/main/resources/application-local.properties) *(when running through IDE)*, or
   - [mimoto-default.properties](docker-compose/config/mimoto-default.properties) *(when running through Docker)*:
    ```properties
    spring.session.store-type=redis   # Store HTTP sessions in Redis
    spring.cache.type=redis           # Store application data in Redis
    ```

3. **Add the required Redis configurations** in
   - [application-local.properties](src/main/resources/application-local.properties) or
   - [mimoto-default.properties](docker-compose/config/mimoto-default.properties), similar to those in the [application-default.properties](src/main/resources/application-default.properties) file.  
     Look for properties starting with:
   - `spring.data.redis.*`
   - `spring.session.redis.*`

### with docker-compose
1. To simplify running mimoto in local for developers we have added [Docker Compose Setup](docker-compose/README.md). This docker-compose includes mimoto service and nginx service to server static data.
2. Follow the below steps to use custom build image in docker-compose
* Build the mimoto.jar
  ```mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests=true```
* Build docker image by running the below command in the directory where Dockerfile is present, use any image tag
  ```docker build -t <image-with-tag> .```
* Use newly built docker image in docker-compose file
